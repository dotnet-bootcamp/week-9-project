We are building a simple web application that allows users (_movie viewers_) to sign up for an account on our web app which allows them to write movie reviews. We want to support the following user actions.

- The user can post a review for the movies they have seen. 
- Users can also browse all movies and see other users reviews of the movie
- Users can browse all other user's movie reviews
    + and they can filter the reviews by the movies genre, the year the movie was released, or the date the review was posted.
